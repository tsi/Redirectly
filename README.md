A Chrome extension that provides powerful URL redirection and cookie setting capabilities using Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API.

## Features

## Getting Started

1. [Download the zip](https://github.com/tsi/Redirectly/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tsi/Redirectly.git
   ```

2. Open Extensions page in your browser `chrome://extensions/`

3. Make sure "Developer mode" is enabled (switch in the top-right corner)

## How It Works

Redirectly works by intercepting web requests that match your specified patterns and:
1. Redirecting them to a different URL (redirect rules)
2. Setting specific cookies (cookie rules)

All rules support wildcard patterns, allowing for powerful matching configurations.

## Privacy

Redirectly respects your privacy:
- All rules are stored locally in your browser
- No data is sent to any external servers
- No analytics or tracking
